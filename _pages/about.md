I am currently pursuing my PhD at the [Data Science and Mining Team](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/dascim/) of the Computer Science Laboratory at [Ã‰cole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), under the supervision of Prof. [Michalis Vazirgiannis](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~mvazirg/). In 2022, I completed an internship at Flatiron Institute of Simons Foundation in New York, where I worked on the application of graph neural networks for cancer gene prediction under the guidance of Prof. [Zijun Frank Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YDl3mfgAAAAJ&hl=en).
Prior to this, I graduated from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en). During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a Machine Learning Researcher in [Laboratory of Algebraic and
Geometric Algorithms](http://erga.di.uoa.gr/) at [National and Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en) under the supervision of  Prof. [Ioannis Emiris](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=ZK6y-cIAAAAJ&hl=en). I also successfully completed Google Summer of Code 2019, advised by Prof. [Iraklis Varlamis](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=SUyTkTAAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am deeply passionate about <strong>machine learning on graph-structured data</strong>. My research focuses on developing neural network architectures for graphs, aiming to solve real-world challenges, particularly in domains such as drug discovery and recommendation systems. At present, my research endeavors are directed towards the development of multimodal generative models for <strong>protein representation learning</strong>. This involves the fusion of graph and text data, leveraging <strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</strong> and <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong>. I am also exploring the application of graph representation learning techniques in other fields such as AutoML and Neural Architecture Search.
