I am currently pursuing my PhD at the [Data Science and Mining Team](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/dascim/) of the Computer Science Laboratory at [Ã‰cole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), under the supervision of Prof. [Michalis Vazirgiannis](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~mvazirg/). In 2022, I completed an internship at Flatiron Institute's Simons Foundation in New York, where I worked on the application of graph neural networks for cancer gene prediction under the guidance of Prof. [Zijun Frank Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YDl3mfgAAAAJ&hl=en).
Prior to this, I graduated from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en). During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a Machine Learning Researcher in [Laboratory of Algebraic and
Geometric Algorithms](http://erga.di.uoa.gr/) at [National and Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en) under the supervision of  Prof. [Ioannis Emiris](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=ZK6y-cIAAAAJ&hl=en). I also successfully completed Google Summer of Code 2019, advised by Prof. [Iraklis Varlamis](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=SUyTkTAAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests lie in the field of <strong>machine learning for graph-structured data</strong>, with a focus on developing innovative deep learning architectures for graphs and applying them to real-world problems such as drug discovery and recommendation systems. 
My current research interests are directed towards the creation of multimodal generative models for protein representation learning, combining both graph and text data, using <strong>Graph Neural Networks</strong> and <strong>LLMs</strong>.
I am also exploring the application of graph representation learning techniques in the fields of <strong>AutoML</strong> and <strong>Neural Architecture Search</strong>.
